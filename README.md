# diff_files_program

I developed this program for Week 4 of the "Python Data Representations" Rice University 
Coursera course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-representation) which is part of the
Introduction to Scripting in Python Specialization 
(https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-scripting-in-python).

Project Description:
In this project you will find differences in the contents of two files. In particular, you 
will find the location of the first character that differs between two input files. You 
might want to do something like this if you are comparing how something has changed. It 
is convenient to present to the user the first difference to allow them to see what 
has happened. Your project will return a four line string that looks as follows:

Line 3:abcd==^abef

Notes:
The 10 files attached are sample files to diff.
